## 🛠️ When You Get Stuck

Here are some steps to try before asking for help:

1. **Check your file names**  
   - Your homepage must be named `index.html` (all lowercase).  
   - CSS file must be `style.css`.  

2. **Check your tags**  
   - Tags usually come in pairs:  
     ```html
     <p>Text goes here</p>
     ```  
   - If you forget the closing tag (`</p>`), weird things happen.  

3. **Refresh the page**  
   - Wait 1–2 minutes after saving on GitHub.  
   - Try **hard refresh**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Chromebook) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac).  

4. **Compare with a working example**  
   - Look at the starter code.  
   - Spot the differences carefully (capital letters, missing quotes, etc.).  

5. **Ask AI for help**  
   - Copy the code that isn’t working.  
   - Ask: *“Why doesn’t this work?”*  
   - Or ask: *“How do I change ___ in HTML/CSS?”*

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Start small: change one thing at a time and check if it worked.  
- Use comments to remind yourself what code does:  
  ```html
  <!-- This is a comment. It won’t show up on the website. -->
